        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   An asynchronous function `send_pushover_notification` was successfully defined, capable of sending messages to Pushover using `httpx.AsyncClient`, with built-in error handling for HTTP and request-related issues.\n",
        "*   A `function_tool` named `check_and_notify_unreadable_content` was created. This tool utilizes `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML, extract, and clean text, and then checks if the cleaned text length falls below a 200-character readability threshold. If deemed unreadable, it triggers the `send_pushover_notification` function.\n",
        "*   Testing with `https://sullivanexcavatinginc.com/` confirmed its content as unreadable, with only 23 characters of extracted text, and a Pushover notification was successfully sent.\n",
        "*   Testing with `https://www.google.com/` also resulted in the content being identified as unreadable, with only 6 characters of extracted text, leading to a Pushover notification. This demonstrates that the readability assessment strictly adheres to the raw text character count after HTML parsing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current readability assessment, based solely on character count, may produce false positives for pages that are visually rich or interactive with minimal raw text content (e.g., `https://www.google.com/`).\n",
        "*   To improve accuracy, consider integrating more advanced readability metrics or filtering mechanisms that focus on visible, meaningful text content, rather than just the total extracted character count from raw HTML.\n"
